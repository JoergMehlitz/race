// example of how to export JMS via embedded JMS broker
// build with `sbt stage`, then:
//    script/swimwerver      (as a message producer)
//    script/race config/exports/jms.conf
//    script/swimclient --port 61617  (to connect to the RACE JMS broker)
//
// then send message from swimServer console, it should appear in the swimClient
